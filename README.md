# Coin tossing web application
This is a web application created with HTML, CSS and JavaScript (VanillaJs). This implementation is just a beta version and coin tossing animation will be coming in the future.
The application should be easy enough to use for everybody. Choose whether you want a head or tail as your guess, toss the coin and see the result ðŸ˜‰.
Any contribution/feedback will be highly appreciated. For contribution/feedback please email me at longphamduy2002@gmail.com
